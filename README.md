# ExoPlayList

In this application, I played a playlist with ExoPlayer. After downloading the videos to the device, I asked for user permission and then played the videos.
I extensively examined the ExoPlayer events and used Fragment and Activity Lifecycle.
I ensured that the player continued playing when the screen was rotated, and also made the landscape layout inflate. 


# What is ExoPlayer?

<p>ExoPlayer is a media player library designed specifically for the Android operating system. It was developed by Google and released as an open-source project.

ExoPlayer is designed to play media content (video and audio files) and supports many different media formats. It is particularly suitable for video streaming and online media services because it is compatible with DRM (Digital Rights Management) technologies.

Compared to the Android MediaPlayer class, ExoPlayer offers more features and an advanced user interface. For example, it supports features such as adjusting playback speed, searching media content, performing conversion operations, displaying subtitles, and loading media files from multiple sources.

ExoPlayer is easily customizable and has a flexible structure. Customized versions are also available for various platforms. Therefore, developers often use ExoPlayer for Android applications that require media playback functionality.</p>
